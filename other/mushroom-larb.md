no comment, it's just great!

## ingredients

- 2boxes shiitake mushrooms
- vegetable oil
- roasted peanuts
- 3 scallions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1inch ginger
- 1 shallot
- 1 red chile
- mint leaves
- 1spn fish sauce
- 1 head lettuce
- lime wedges
- salt

## preparation

roast peanuts if not already roasted, give them a #roughchop. remove stems from shiitake and dice in ~5mm cubes. slice chile, shallot and scallions in rounds. grate ginger and garlic. separate the lettuce leaves.

pour some veg oil in pan, add mushrooms, give them a quick toss to coat evenly then *don't touch them* for ~5m in which they will first loose all water then start browning on the bottom. then toss them to flip and leave for 2 more minutes & repeat until evenly browned.

add some more oil, garlic, ginger, scallions and cook for a couple more minutes.

turn off heat and add half peanuts, fish sauce, shallot, chile, mint, salt (if needed). toss to mix.

serve with cabbage leaves and wedges on the side and some extra peanuts on top

## notes

lettuce works great instead of the original cabbage b/c nice crunch

savoy cabbage works too but it lacks that nice crunchiness and needs boiling for ~2 minutes and it tends to stay watery
