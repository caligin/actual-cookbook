## notes

I had no idea how garlic chives tasted like and had none at hand so tried replacing with leek. Don't to this. Leek is quite out of place in this recipe tbh. I still have no idea what to use instead of chives, PR welcome lol.

The pre-made frozen gyoza wrapes are super convenient and I think you can find them in any asian supermarket. Look out for the last 2-3 at the bottom of the pack that tend to stick together once you get them out of the freezer.
