## notes

these freeze very well, hence why the recipe is for such a big batch

if you can't get your hands on chives try with the green part of scallions. chinese chives are the best option if you can find them. I once tried to replace with leek - don't do that that's stupid it just tastes so wrong.

The pre-made frozen gyoza wrapes are super convenient and I think you can find them in any asian supermarket. Look out for the last 2-3 at the bottom of the pack that tend to stick together once you get them out of the freezer.
if you use frozen wrappers, thaw them in the fridge first overnight then at room temp or they will tear horribly
