# hirata buns

soft fluffly dreams of deliciousness

from: [Hirata Buns](https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipes/809-hirata-buns)

this is the recipe for the buns, filling is up to you. a mix of [chasfoo](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/meat/chasfoo.md) and [buttersoy mushrooms](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/other/buttersoy-mushrooms.md) is highly recommended and (consistently successful at house parties).

serves: whoever can eat 6 buns

## tools

- steamer
- baking paper

## ingredients

- 300g flour
- 3g yeast
- 3g baking powder
- 35g sugar
- salt
- 170ml lukewarm water
- sesame oil

## preparation

- sift the flour
- mix all the dry ingredients
- add water, mix to make dough
- cover with a damp towel and leave to raise for at least 1h
- separate in 6 pieces
- use the sesame oil on your hand and around the ball of dough you're working to prevent it from sticking
- make a flat, long oval shape then fold on itself in half. the light sesame oil coating should prevent it from merging on its own
- put on a piece of baking paper and steam 12m

## notes

I never remember to sift the flour and my dough always came up very lumpy and not as soft as it could be so I highly recommend sifting the flour. if you try that and find out that's not what makes the different send me a pr lol
