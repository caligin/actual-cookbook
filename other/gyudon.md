# gyudon

from: [Gyudon (Japanese Beef Bowl) 牛丼](https://www.justonecookbook.com/gyudon/)

quick, filling and tasty (but indeed requires a rice cooker)

serves 2.

## ingredients

- sushi white rice for 2
- 1 or 2 steaks (rump or sirloin)
- 1 onion
- 1spn sugar
- 2spn sake
- 2spn mirin
- 2spn soysauce
- benishoga (red pickled ginger)
- 3 scallions
- 2 eggs
- veg oil

## preparation

prepare rice in a rice cooker.

slice 1 onion. chop scallions and set aside. slice thinly benishoga and set aside.

heat oil over medium heat and cook onions until soft. add meat and sugar, toss to mix and cook until no longer pink. add sake, mirin and soysauce and simmer for 3 minutes to reduce a little.

place rice in 2 bowls, put meat&sauce mix on top leaving a little crater in the center. crack eggs, reserve white and put yolk in the center of bowl. top with scallion and benishoga.

## notes

amounts and preparation for the rice is left as an exercise for the reader. yumenishiki pink is my fav brand for this.

original recipe calls for 1spn soysauce but go 2 or it's not salty enough

reserved egg whites can be used in a cocktail e.g. whisky sour, fridge them in a bowl to use later.
