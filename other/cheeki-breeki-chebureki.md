## notes

Recipe works fine even if it's not middle of night and not cousin's place.

There's no "too big" cheburek but having them bigget than the size of your pan doesn't help.

Works better with pork mince or a mix that is mainly pork.

Well suited to last long in the freezer and serve as emergency rations.

Can easily be cooked in a deep fryer, set around 170 and fry for a few (5?) minutes-ish, until golden.
