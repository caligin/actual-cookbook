from: [Sauteed Mushroom with Soy Butter Sauce - Japanese Cooking 101](https://youtu.be/XnCXAvhmRzI)

this. thing. is. so. simple. and. delicious.

serves: hmmm idk depends on how much mushrooms you add? but it's a side so just go for how much you feel like

## ingredients

- some mushrooms
- some soy sauce
- some butter
- salt
- pepper
- 1spn vegetable oil

## prepraation

- heat oil in pan
- introduce mushrooms, saute for a couple of minutes until tender
- add a chunk of butter and splash with soy sauce
- sprinke wil salt and pepper
- saute for a few more minutes until mushrooms start first to absrob the butter and soy and then getting lightly golden and crispy

## notes

Original recipe calls for shiitake but any mushroom that is reasonably flavoursome would do.

Amount of oil and minutes until tender will vary a lot depending on mushroom type, how much they absorb oil and how thick they're cut.

Perfect filling for [hirata buns](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/other/hirata-buns.md) in combination with some [chasfoo](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/meat/chasfoo.md).
