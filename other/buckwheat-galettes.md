# buckwheat galettes


Batter for the buckwheat galettes comes together super quick and easy, makes approximately 10+ galettes and batter keeps overnight.  Fill with whatever tickles your fancy but a few personal favorites:

- ham, egg, gruyere
- spinach sauteed with sliced garlic, egg, gruyere
- mushrooms sauteed with sliced garlic and herbs, egg, gruyere

## ingredients

- 330g buckwheat flour
- 1 large egg
- 750ml water
- pinch of salt

## preparation

Mix the flour, egg, water and salt together with a whisk and leave batter for 2 hours or overnight in the fridge (optional). 

Heat a flat, non-stick pan (4 on our electric hob) and coat with a thin layer of olive oil.

Add full ladle of the batter to pan and swirl the pan so that the batter covers the entire base of the pan in a thin and even layer. You should see bubbles forming immediately when the batter hits the pan and the galette should take on a lacy pattern. It's normal for the first galette to come out thick and un-usable. 

Crack a whole egg in the middle of the galette and spread the egg whites with a palette/dinner knife - this is to help the whites cook evenly. Hold the egg yolk in position with the knife (take care to not pop the yolk!) while adding some grated cheese along on side of the yolk - this will keep the yolk from sliding all over the place and you will end up with a prettier end result. Distribute more cheese around the galette and then add your sauteed veg or filling of choice. 

Season the galette with salt and pepper before folding the edges of the galette with a spatula to form a square - leave the yolk and some toppings around the yolk exposed. Cover for 1 minute to let the cheese melt and then serve.
