# pizza dough

makes 2 wide pizzas

## ingredients

- 180ml water
- 480ml flour
- 1 spn dried active yeast
- 1 cspn sugar
- 1 spn salt
- 3 spn evoo

## preparation

warm up water. dissolve yeast in water. sift flour, sugar and salt together in a bowl. make a little hole in the middle of the mixture, pour in it 1 spn of evoo and start slowly adding the yeast mix while mixing in with four mix from center outwards, to make it gradual. repeat with the remaingin evoo and yeast mixture a little at a time, giving it a little kneading until dough is not (that) sticky and smooth. cut in at least 2 pieces. oil the surface of a bowl for each dough piece you cut and let dough rest in them covered in cling film in a warm place for 1h. give dough a good knead until bouncy with extra flouring when ready to use, then roll from center outwards leaving extra thicccness on the crust. if you're italian, you can use your stereotipically assumed pizza making superpowers to juggle pizza in that cool way that makes it *really* italian. or maybe don't to avoid a disaster dough, much embarassment and the regret of having fed the trolls.

## notes

keep the flour pack at hand, you always need plenty for extra flouring and dusting surfaces and stuff.

remember to cut dough with a knife, don't tear it or it kinda kills the elasticity that you're trying to create with the kneading.

first run of this recipe had half the salt and was left raising for only 30m. hypotesis is that a full 1h raising allows to cut 3 decent-size pizzas instead of 2 moderately wide. was also short on salt so other hypotesis is that 1spn sould be alright. experiment and pr as needed.
