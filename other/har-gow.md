steamed shrimpy deliciousness

from: [Har Gow (Dim Sum Shrimp Dumplings)](https://thewoksoflife.com/2015/10/har-gow/)

serves: a full dinner for 2 but you would normally have a few as an appetizer, not as a full main

## ingredients

- 300g raw tiger prawns
- 1cspn minced ginger

- pepper pepper pepper
- 1cspn oyster sauce
- 1spn vegetable oil
- a pinch of white pepper
- 1cspn sesame oil
- a pinch of salt
- 1cspn sugar
- a handful of bamboo shots
- [har gow shells](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/other/har-gow-shells.md)

## preparation

- pat dry well the shrimps before doing anything else
- give the shrimps a good, coarse chop. the result should be mostly like a paste but with some chunkier bites around. you can use the flat of your knife to squash them first to make the chopping smoother
- chop the bamboo shots
- mix everything except the bamboo shots to make a paste
- when it's sticky introduce the bamboo shots and mix again
- cover with cling foil and leave sit in the fridge for at least 10m
- prepare your steamer
- fill the shells, seal and steam for 12m

## notes

original recipe calls for 1/4 cup bamboo shots but I don't speak cups soooo a small handful it is
