# ppajeori

ppajeori is a spring onion salad that simply cannot be missed in a korean bbq.

## ingredients

- 6 spring onions
- 1spn gochugaru
- 1spn sugar
- 1spn soy sauce
- .5spn fish sauce
- 1spn rice vinegar
- 1spn sesame oil

## preparation

shred the spring onion in thin strips. using a specific tool (ネギカッター) is recommended.
otherwise a good way of doing that is to halve the spring onion lengthwise, fold it over and julienne the folded pieces.
way easier than cutting long strips with a knife.

mix the rest of ingredients together in a separate bowl and use them as dressing on the green onions just before serving.

## notes

says 6 spring onions but the same amount of dressing can likely scale in the range of 5-9 depending on how big your spring onions are and how much dressing you like to use.
