# okonomiyaki

aka the japanese pizza. this is the recipe for the "foo mix v0.1.0" but you can replace the fillings with whatever (see notes).

serves 2

## ingredients

- 2 egg
- 200g cabbage
- 100g flour
- 3g baking soda
- 170 ml water
- 3g dashi powder
- 7 streaks bacon
- 150g gyoza mix
- 200g cooked prawns
- 150g shiitake
- vegetable oil
- katsuobushi
- nori sprinkle
- mayo
- okonomi sauce

## preparation

boil water, then turn off hear, mix in dashi powder and let cool so it gets warm and not hot. shred cabbage and shiitake in strips.

heat up some vegatable oil in a pan and sear prawns a couple of minutes per side, to release excess water and apply a light browning. after removing prawns, circulate dashi stock through the pan to get some extra prawny flavour.

heat up some veg oil in a pan and fry the bacon streaks on one side only until not raw and golden on the bottom.

in a bowl mix flour and baking soda, then slowly mix in dashi stock to form the base batter. add gyoza mix. layer shredded cabbage, shiitake and prawns on top and crack 2 eggs on it.

in a large pan heat up some veg oil. while it heats up, roughly mix the contents of the bowl all together. it will look like it's missing batter but it's actually alright. pour contents in the pan and using two spatulas shape it and flatten it so it's compact. apply bacon streaks on top, fried side in contact with the batter, and press with your spatulas to some batter attaches to bacon. apply a lid and cook until crisp on bottom (~6 minutes), then flip bacon side down and cook for ~3 more minutes until bacon golden.

top with a double spiral of okonomi sauce and mayo, sprinkle nori and katsuobushi and serve.

## notes

recipe is written to make one massive okonomiyaki for 2 people but you can do 2 individual ones if you prefer, depending on cooking surface available.

see gyoza recipe for gyoza mix.
you don't have to use this, I happened to have some leftovers from making gyozas the day before and it's brilliant. if you don't use it. keep in mind that to substitute filling you want to maintain the ratio of "solid" stuff and "paste-y" stuff to prevent the okonomiyaki from crumbling. I'd say that if you don't use it then reduce the amount of prawns (half?) to balance and throw in the mix a combination of any or all: chives (or green onions), grated garlic, grated ginger, onion, sesame oil, soysauce.

I like with the above but fillings can be whatever you like! brilliant recipe to use those fridge leftovers.
