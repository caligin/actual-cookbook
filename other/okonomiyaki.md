# okonomiyaki

I keep forgetting how to do this and the ratios. I guess I'll finish this next time I try to cook it again.

## ingredients

- 1 egg
- cabbage
- did it need any flour at all?
- ??
- bacon
- fillings!

fishy option
- shrimps

mushroomy option
- which kind of mushrooms go well in here again??

okonomi sauce:
- ketchup
- oyster sauce (right?)
- sugar

TODO quantities/ratios, review entire recipe. it's been too long since last time.

## preparation

- cut bacon stripes half-length
- mix all ingredients together
- heat pan at mid-high with a light layer of oil
- pour mix in center of pan and shape as a dish
- apply bacon on top, press gently to embed in the top
- cook 5-6 minutes ish covered with lid
- flip over on the bacon side and cook for 4 more minutes
- flip again, apply mayo, okonomi sauce, seaweed and bonito flakes on top
- serve

TODO check timings

## notes

Consistency of the mix is super important, if it's too liquid the whole thing will just fall apart.

If you can't find bonito flakes or the seaweed dust it's not a big deal.

Fillings can be whatever you like! Brilliant recipe to use those fridge leftovers.
