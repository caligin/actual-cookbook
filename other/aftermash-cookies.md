# aftermash cookies

I wanted to find a way to recycle the spent grains from mashing for beer and the first idea I found was to make cookies. I found a recipe but I didn't have half of the ingredients so I just threw in a bowl random amounts of everything.

Shoud get approx 10 cookies out of this

## tools

- oven
- baking tray (or normal tray with baking paper)

## ingredients

- 200g spent grains from mashing
- ~100ml milk 
- ~200g flour
- ~50g butter
- 1 lemon
- 1 handful of raisins
- 1spn honey
- 1spn maple syrup
- ~50g sugar

## preparation

- preheat oven at 200c
- melt butter
- throw everything in a bowl except lemon and butter
- zest the lemon peel
- add the butter while still hot, then mix and modl on a baking tray while still warm
- bake 20m

## notes

All amounts are indicative and probably not representative of reality. Just throw how much you feel like, you're probably still looking after your boil at this point and dedicating too much attention to amounts for cookies is gonna distract you from caring for your hops instead.
