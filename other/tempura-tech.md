The interesting part is not the recipe per se but the technique, that applies to pretty much anything you want to tempura (I can use tempura as a verb right?). 

I tried like 4 times and I keep buying the wrong type of fish. For some reason sea bream is impossible for my brain to recognize.

If you're in the uk you can find the tempura mix at a Sainsbury's with a big enough asian department, probably hiding next to the corn flour.
