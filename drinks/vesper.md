# vesper

insert james bond joke here. I swear I didn't know that this was james bond's drink when I started making these. recipe from [bon appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/vesper), copied here for ease of access.

## ingredients

- 45ml london dry gin
- 30ml vodka
- 15ml lillet blanc
- lemon peel

## preparation

add everything in a mixing glass with ice and stir 007 times clockwise to chill. then stir a little more because 007 times clockwise sounds fine for the joke but I'm not sure it's half enough to chill well. double strain in chilled martini glass. squeeze lemon peel to express oils on drink's surface, then twist it and add to garnish.

## notes

delicious made with portobello road gin and russian standard vodka.

yes it's stirred, not shaken.
