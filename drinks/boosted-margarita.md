# boosted margarita

A take on Margarita with some stronger flavours

## tools

- shaker
- jigger for the measures
- strainer

## ingredients

- 2 bjig tequila reposado
- 1 bjig lime juice
- 1 sjig orange cointreau
- 1 sjig simple syrup
- 1 half lime slice for garnish
- flake salt
- ice

## preparation

after squeezing limes, use remaining peel to rim the glass rind so that salt can stick to it. pour some salt on a flat surface and roll the glass over it to get the salt attached.

add everything in a shaker with ice, shake, strain in the glasses.

## notes

1 bjig lime juice is approx 1 lime, littleless. Would recommend to put extra lime than less lime (so like for 2 people instead of 2 limes go 2.5 or even 3).

a double strain is recommended if you have a second, finer strainer

simple syrup can be replaced with maple syrup for a funny aftertaste addition

if you want to morph it to a long drink, ginger beer is the way to go
