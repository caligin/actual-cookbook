# white lady

## ingredients

- 45ml london dry gin
- 22ml lemon juice
- 22ml triple sec
- 15ml simple syrup
- 22ml egg white

## preparation

mix all ingredients in a shaker without ice. long shake to foam (30-45s). add ice to shaker. shake to dilute and chill (20s). double strain in a coupe glass.

## notes

22ml egg white is about little less than a medium egg white. using a whole egg white (about 30ml) is totally ok but methinks that less is more balanced
