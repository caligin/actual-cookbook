# angry russian

White russian, but with foamy milk.

## tools

- shaker
- (optional) jigger for the measures

## ingredients

- 2 measures kalhua
- 3 measures vodka (russian standard is my go-to one)
- 3 measures milk (not sure which one, I think the one that linges in the fridge is uk's "blue" one, whatever that means)
- ice

## preparation

Throw kalhua, vodka and ice in a glass (old fahioned glass works best)

Throw milk in shaker with ice and shake angrily. After a while some milk will still be liquid and not foamy, use the strainer to pour it in a second container/glass, then remove the strainer and slowly pour the foamy milk in the glass. If it has the right consistency it will layer effortlessly. Repeat shaking with the remaining milk.

## notes

I tend to use double measures.

Don't forget to remove the milk that is still liquid before pouring or it will ruin the layering
