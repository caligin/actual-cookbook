# shooting star martini

replace vodka from base recipe from here https://craftybartending.com/cocktail-recipes/porn-star-martini/ with 55ml gin London dry. fruit yield calls from roughly 2 pfruit and 1 lime

## ingredients

- 55ml london dry gin
- 15ml passoa
- 15ml vanilla syrup
- 15ml lime juice
- 1 passionfruit
- 30ml chapagne

## preparation

mix gin, passoa, syrup, lime juice and juice and pulp of 1 passionfruit in a shaker with ice. double strain in chilled martini or coupe glass. serve shot of champagne on side.

## notes

lime yield calls for roughly half a lime. if you want to be fancy a.f. you can float half a hollowed passionfruit and pour the champagne inside it.

any other sparkling wine would do in absence of chapagne but would recommend a cremont or brut over a prosecco (although I'm biased and not a fan of prosecco)
