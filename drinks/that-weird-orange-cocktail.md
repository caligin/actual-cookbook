# that weird orange cocktail

not sure how I came up with this - I think there was some stray orange that needed using in the fridge and adapted some random recipe from the internet to what I had at hand

## ingredients

- 45ml smoky whisky
- 22.5ml lemon juice
- 22.5ml simple syrup
- 15ml gran classico
- 15ml orange juice
- 2 dash orange bitters

## preparation

shake all ingredients, double strain.

## notes

smoky whisky can be replaced with mezcal. gran classico can be replaced with some other sweetish herbal amaro, but it *must* have an orange peel component.
