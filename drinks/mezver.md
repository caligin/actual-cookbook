# mezver

like a versper, but mezcal

## ingredients

- 45ml vodka
- 30ml mezcal
- 15ml kina l'areo d'or

## preparation

stir, garnish with grapefruit twist expressing oils

## notes

yes, unlike a vesper there's more vodka than base spirit - found out that it balances better like this with a mezcal that is more aromatic than smoky.
these ratios are with a wyborova vodka and dangerous don mezcal, using something smokier mezcal might need adjustment (or consider not doing this at all).
