# mana potion

There are many ways to prepare this and everything is legit as long as it looks like a mana potion. This is the recipe that I prefer atm.

## tools

- shaker
- (optional) jigger for the measures

## ingredients

- 1 measure blue curacao
- 1 measure vodka (used the lone wolf one for this but russian standard works perfectly too)
- 1 measure lemon juice
- ice

## preparation

Acquire alchemy skill. Farm/buy materials to level it up to at least level 375 (this can take several years).

Throw all ingredients in the shaker and give it some violence.

I think it should be served in a martini glass but I don't have any so I use a brewdog tasting glass instead (looks like a wine tasting glass but very small).

## notes

You can technically prepare this without alchemy skill but you'll end up with something that is just a nice drink and doesn't actually refill any mana.
