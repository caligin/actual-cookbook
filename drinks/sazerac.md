I didn't get how good this is until I tried with actual rye (used to only have scotch around).
recipe from [Truffles On The Rocks](https://youtu.be/zkUay6o9gBE), adapted for lack of the right bitters.

## ingredients

- 60ml rye whisky
- 7.5ml simple syrup
- 2dash angostura bitters
- 3sprays absinthe
- lemon zest

## preparation

stir with ice, spray a chilled tumbler glass with absinthe before pouring over. express oils of lemon and discard.

## notes

I made it with a templeton 4yr - it's fantastic. had to replace peychauds (in the original recipe) for angostura because that's what I had.

TOTR's recipe also uses 2 dashes absinthe stirred in - I prefer not to and go lighter on it
