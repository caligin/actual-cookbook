# fair harvard

I tend to call this "the pisco [vesper](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/drinks/vesper.md)". recipe from [Difford's Guide](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/5000/fair-harvard)

## ingredients

- 60ml pisco
- 30ml dry vermouth
- 3dash orange bitters
- lemon peel

## preparation

stir with ice. garnish with lemon twist.

## notes

my go-to dry vermouth atm is regal rogue. using americano cocchi works quite nice too
