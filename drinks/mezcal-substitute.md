# mezcal substitute

discovered by mistake experimenting, this combination is similar enough to a mezcal that I would't be offended by having it as a replacement in a cocktail.

## ingredients

- 10ml smoky whisky
- 10ml vodka
- 10ml tequila reposado

## preparation

mix.

## notes

ingredients given as 10ml but this scales 1:1:1 so whatever your target need of mezcal is /3.
