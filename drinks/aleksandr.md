# aleksandr

an alexander with a twist. or lack thereof, as I made this only once and I don't know which twist to add to it yet lol

## tools

- shaker
- jigger for the measures
- strainer

## ingredients

- 1 bjig 1 sjig gin
- 1 bjig 1 sjig doublecream+milk mix
- ice
- little more than half a sjig (~12.5ml) sugar syrup
- some powdery thing for garnish (???)

## preparation

add gin, doublecream+milk mix, syrup and ice in shaker. show it some hell. strain pour in glass and garnish with powder

## notes

I don't remember which powdery things are legit on this but I seem to remember that raspberry is dope. should totally try chili and paprika though, sounds fun.
