my take on an alexander

## tools

- shaker
- jigger for the measures
- strainer

## ingredients

- 45ml gin
- 45ml milk
- 15ml vanilla syrup
- raspberry powder
- ice

## preparation

add gin, doublecream+milk mix, syrup and ice in shaker. show it some hell. strain pour in glass and garnish with powder

## notes

I don't remember which powdery things are legit on this but I seem to remember that raspberry is dope. should totally try chili and paprika though, sounds fun.
