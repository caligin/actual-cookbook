# maison verte clone

the folks at coupette in bethnal green use to have the maison verte on the menu and it was glorious, this is an attempt to recreate something similar

## ingredients

- 50ml tequila blanco
- 15ml dry vermouth
- 1dash celery bitters
- tonic to top

## preparation

stirred, serve in highball glass with ice balls

## notes

it supposedly has "spruce" in it, idk in which form. cordial I guess?
