# banana bread

This recipe is adapted from [BA's best banana bread](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-bread). Conversions to grams because we don't use cups and sugar has been reduced as the original is too sweet. I find that if you use super ripe bananas it makes the addition of chocolate redundant as you already get those sweet, chocolatey notes from the mashed and cooked banana. 

## ingredients

- 192g plain flour
- 1 1/4 tsp baking soda
- pinch of salt
- 150g light brown sugar
- sprinkle of brown caster sugar
- 125g mascarpone (room temp)
- 57g softened butter
- 2 eggs
- dash of vanilla extract
- 4 mashed bananas <!-- To Do: Add banana weight -->

## preparation

Pre-heat oven to 170 C. 

Grease and line loaf tin/or dust inside with flour.

Mix flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl.

Cream the butter and soft brown sugar till soft and fluffy in a stand mixer for a few mins on medium speed, then add in the mascarpone. Beat until the mixture looks smooth and fluffy.

Add egg one at a time and beat until incorporated.

Set mixer on low and add flour slowly.

Fold in the mashed bananas.

Transfer mixture to the loaf tin and sprinkle a dusting of brown caster sugar on top - this gives the crust some nice crunch.

Bake for 45 mins and check that the chopstick/skewer comes out clean.
