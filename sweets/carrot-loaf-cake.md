# carrot loaf cake

This recipe can also be used to make cup cakes, just adjust the cooking time and use the poke test (chopstick comes out clean) for timing.

This cake keeps well in the fridge for a few days and stays moist.

Leave mascarpone out at room temp for a few hours as if you make the icing with cold soft cheese it will be lumpy.

To rectify lumpy icing you can whisk it a bit over a baine-marie.

## Icing

- 50g butter (room temp)
- 150g mascarpone cheese (room temp)
- 50g icing sugar,sifted
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

## ingredients

- 200g grated carrot
- zest of 1 orange
- 200g self-raising flour
- 110ml neutral oil
- 75g brown caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- 2 tbsp all spice
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda

## preparation

Prep loaf tin - either by using a bit of oil and then flour coat the inside or add a strip of baking paper length ways long enough for edges to hang over the side.

Heat oven to 160C for fan assisted oven.

Mix flour, sugar, bicarb of soda, spice and orange zest.

Whisk eggs and oil then stir into the flour mixture. Add grated carrot and mix.

Bake for 30 mins until the poke test passes.

Let the loaf cool before icing.

For the icing, beat the butter in stand mixer and then beat in the mascarpone, icing sugar and mix. Ice the loaf.
