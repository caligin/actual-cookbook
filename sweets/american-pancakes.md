# American style pancakes

Basic pancake recipe, perfect for those lazy sunday mornings. Adapted from [bbc good food recipe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fluffyamericanpancak_74828).


## Ingredients

- 135g plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Â½ tsp salt
- 2 tbsp brown caster sugar
- 130ml whole milk
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tbsp melted butter (allowed to cool slightly) 
- Rice bran oil for cooking
  
 ### Optional toppings

- Strawberries
- Blueberries
- Maple syrup 
- Streaky bacon (fried until cripsy)
- Vanilla greek yogurt

## Preparation

Melt butter on low heat.

Prep any toppings e.g. wash and cut fruit, fry bacon

Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl.
 
In a separate bowl lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then whisk in the butter.

Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture and, using a whisk, beat until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.

Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium/low heat and add a few drops of rice bran oil. Add a small ladle of batter. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown.

Top with ingredients of choice and best served warm with lashings of maple syrup.
