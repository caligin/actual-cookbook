# tiramisu

this is my grandma's prized recipe. it's just. sogood.

## ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 250g mascarpone
- 1 3-people coffee moka
- 16 savoiardi (sponge biscuits)
- 2spn sugar
- cocoa powder
- dark chocolate
- 1spn grappa

## preparation

arrange savoiardi on a tray, drench them in hot coffee and leave to absorb.

separate eggs yolks from whites in 2 different bowls.

add sugar to yolks, mix until incorporated. add grappa and mix to incorporate. add mascarpone and mix to incorporate.

beat egg whites to stiff peaks. gently fold it into the rest of the mix.

arrange in a deep tray a layer of 8 savoiardi, cover with half the cream mix, dust cocoa powder, repeat for a second layer. top with grated chocolate. let chill for at least 4 hours.

## notes

it's important to fold the egg white last or it will collapse (I once forgot the mascarpone as I was in arush and added it on top - that was a disaster)

your tiramisu will taste best 24h after fridging.

I have no idea how much coffee is contained in a 3-people moka. I might measure next time if I remember to.

if you *can pick* a grappa for this, use a barrel-aged one.

triple sec is a brilliant replacement for grappa.
