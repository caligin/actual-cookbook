# herrburger

That stays for "herb burger" but with the wrong double consonant to maximize confusion.

This is a reidiculously low effort burger but I thought reporting the spice combo was worthwile

Serves 1.

## ingredients

- 2 burger patties (beef works best)
- black pepper
- thyme
- majoran
- nutmeg
- butter
- a drop of oil or 4

## preparation

- sprinkle pepper, majoran, nutmeg and thyme on both sides of patties
- melt butter on mid-high fire
- apply meat in pan
- cook however you prefer it
- ggwp

## notes

I generally cut an X incision on both sides of the patty to make sure it comes out well done. I seem to understand that a well-done burger is often considered heresy but I often end up freezing patties sometimes even for long so well done it is, just to be on the safe side. A pan with a lid also helps in that scenario.

If you want it rare or however else, go for it!

Yep, I didn't forget about it, no bread!
