From [How To Make Creamy Garlic Chicken | Chicken With Creamy Garlic Sauce | Easy Chicken Recipe in 20 Min](https://youtu.be/pbp8wFU1gq0).

Can't say no to something loaded with garlic.

## ingredients

- ~4 chicken thighs
- pepper pepper pepper
- salt
- paprika
- 2spn olive oil
- 15 garlic cloves
- chicken broth
- white wine
- yogurt
- double cream
- parsley

## preparation

- sprinkle salt, pepper pepper pepper and paprika on the chicken
- heat up half the olive oil in a pan and add chicken skin side down
- when looks golden flip once, then remove and set aside
- throw away the chicken fat from the pan
- heat half the olive oil
- fry garlic cloves until golden
- add chicken again, skin side up
- add broth, wine, yogurt and double cream
- reduce
- sprinkle parsley

## notes

Chicken broth can be replaced by water if you don't have it.

Be careful not to add too much liquid for the sauce or you'll be waiting for it to reduce for three or four lifetimes.

Be careful when to add yogurt and cream to pour around the chicken and not on top or it will probably get stuck there and you want to keep the skin side up.
