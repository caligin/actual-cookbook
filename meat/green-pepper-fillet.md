# green pepper fillet

Credits to @sbaruzza for this recipe.

Here in the uk there is this ridiculous tradition of getting a perfectly fine steak, politely (and by poliltey I mean passive-aggressively) send it back to the kitchen because it was too exactly-rare-as-you-asked, get the same exact steak back from the kitchen 5 minutes later, rejoice for having contributed to right the wrongs of the world and then *pour a generous amout of a peppercorn sauce you ordered on the side on your steak of justice, just enough to completely drown it*.

I cannot possibly understand this unless you make the peppercorn sauce proper part of the cooking process to join the flavours together. This is what this recipe is about.

Serves 2. Result is medium-rare.

## tools

- kitchen twine

## ingredients

- 2 beef fillets (~300g each)
- ~4 spn double cream
- ~1 spn mustard
- ~4 coffeespn green pepper in brine
- 50g butter
- brandy
- salt

## preparation

- tie some kitchen twine around the fillets so that they retain a circular shape during cooking
- crack half of the green pepper and rub it on both sides of fillets so it sticks
- sprinkle salt
- melt butter, fire on mid-high
- cook fillets 3 minutes ∀ side
- take fillets off pan and leave them on the side
- lower flame to mid-low
- deglaze pan with a gulp of brandy or twenty
- use a wooden spoon or similar to make sure that there are no residuals are sticking to the pan and they all become part of the sauce
- have gulp of brandy for yo'self
- when brandy is mostly evaporated add mustard, cream and remaining peppercorns and stir for ~1 minute
- add the fillets back in and cook 1m ∀ side
- serve drowned in sauce

## notes

If you're lucky enough or your fillets are firm enough that you don't need twine.

If you do the deglazing + sauce with a flame too high it won't become creamy and you risk setting the brandy on fire that is not what you want so watch out.
