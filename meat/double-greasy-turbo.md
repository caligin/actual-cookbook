# double greasy turbo

A variation on the double greasy special, I found myself without carrots but leftover mushrooms one day.

Serves 1.

## tools

- pan with lid

## ingredients

- 2 burger patties (beef works best)
- 1 onion
- 4 chestnut mushrooms
- 2 cheese slices (the cheap melty one sold in slices that actually doesn't have much flavour)
- black peppercorns
- curry powder (rogan josh or similar is my fav)
- black pepper (crushed)
- oil
- a cube of butter butter
- 2 cloves of garlic

## preparation

- cut onion in half-circles
- remove stem of mushrooms and slice them
- chop garlic fine
- pour a big drop of oil in the pan, set fire on mid and melt the butter with the oil
- throw all veggies in, sprinkle with a little curry powder and black pepper
- give it just a quick stir and flip to absorb the oil/butter
- distribute the veggies evenly in the pan
- lay the patties on top of the veggies and close lid
- cook until it looks like they're mostly cooked, stirring from time to time to prevent the veggies to stick
- by that time the veggies should be golden brown too
- flip the burgers, this time with direct contact on the surface of the pan
- close lid and cook for a few more minutes
- add some peppercorns on the patties, then move the veggies on top and seal with a slice of cheese
- close lid again, set flame to low and wait a minute for the cheese to melt
- move to a plate and pour the grease remaining in the pan on top of the cheese

## notes

You can dust the patties in flour for maximum grease retention.

I generally cut an X incision on both sides of the patty to make sure it comes out well done. I seem to understand that a well-done burger is often considered heresy but I often end up freezing patties sometimes even for long so well done it is, just to be on the safe side.

Yep, I didn't forget about it, no bread!
