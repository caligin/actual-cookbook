# bbq rack of pork ribs

adapted from BA's [Best-Ever Barbecued Ribs](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-ever-barbecued-ribs). 

## ingredients

- 2spn crystal sea salt
- 1spn black peppercorns
- 1spn hot smoked paprika
- 1spn mustard seeds
- .5spn gochugaru
- 2spn xiaoxing wine
- 500g rack of pork ribs
- 125ml bbq sauce

## preparation

grind salt, peppercorns, paprika, mustard seeds to a powder and use to coat evenly rack of ribs.
use a double layer of foil to wrap the ribs in a package, add a splash of xiaoxing before sealing.

bbq on medium/high in the package for about 20m (can flip them if you want, unsure how much of a differece it makes but make sure not to spill wine).

open the package and remove foil - wine should have completely evaporated by then. use a brush to coat with sauce both sides,
then flip and reapply every 2-3 minutes (how long it takes for the layer exposed to fire to caramelise). repeat for 2-3 layers per side or until it looks done (about 15 more minutes).

## notes

see bbq sauce recipe in sauces section, the stickiness is a must.

my gas bbq has a lid with thermometer, mid/high reaches about 250C steady with the lid shut.
