# juicy karaage number one

From [Double Fried Chicken Karaage Recipe (Crispy and Juicy Japanese Fried Chicken) | Cooking with Dog](https://youtu.be/CEX_rCVTPKE) and/or [Japanese fried chicken recipe - Tori no karaage - 鳥のから揚げ](https://youtu.be/SFInCMz0goQ).

Karaage is just delicious.

Not sure how many it serves, I use it as a side/snack to share.

## ingredients

- 300g boneless chicken thigh
- 1 spn soy sauce
- 1 spn sake
- 1 coffeespn sesame oil
- salt
- pepper pepper pepper
- 1 coffeespn grated ginger
- 1 coffeespn grated garlic
- 2½ spn corn flour/corn starch (whichever you call it)
- vegetable oil

## preparation

- poke holes in chicken for maximum marinade, then cut in bite-size pieces (~3 per thigh)
- place chicken in bowl with garlic, ginger, sake, sesame oil, soy, salt and pepper
- give it a massage to even the marinade and leave in fridge for at least an hour
- add corn flour in the bowl and mix
- heat up oil at medium heat (~140C) and fry chicken for ~3-4 min
- up the heat to high (~170C) and fry them again for ~1 min
- dry and serve

## notes

Get a way to check the oil temperature like a digital termomether or something, I lost count of times I had it too high and dried out the chicken.

you can optionally add a little beaten egg with starch for the coating but tbh it's better w/o

If you can't find boneless thighs with the skin on get thighs with bone and debone them yourself. It's annoying but [Chef Dai has a cool tutorial on how to cut that bone away more efficiently](https://youtu.be/r0IEiU_-Fjo). I don;t recommend giving up on the skin.
