# chasfoo

Made hirata buns but forgot to prepare some char siu marinade beforehand. Also, a japanese-style chashu is kinda different from a chinese char siu one (btw am I spelling any of this actually correctly??). Plus, I got the wrong cut of pork that doesn't go well in an oven. So with all of this and no time to look up a proper recipe I just improvised with the idea of punping up some sugar content so it goes well pan-fried and this combo turned out to be very successful.

## ingredients

- 2 thin pork loins
- 2 spn honey
- 1 spn soy sauce
- 1 cpsn sake
- 1 cpsn sriracha
- 1 cpsn sesame oil
- 1 cpsn sugar syrup
- 1 cpsn miso

## preparation

- mix everything (except the pork)
- cut the pork in thin slices
- add the marinade, give it a good massage
- rest in the fridge for at least 10 minutes
- pan fry until the marinade is clearly forming a glaze and becomes sticky and crispy

## notes

Perfectly fine to use the same marinade for pork belly slices cooked in the oven. Might be better with some added starch in that case.

Perfect filling for [hirata buns](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/other/hirata-buns.md) in combination with some [buttersoy mushrooms](https://github.com/caligin/actual-cookbook/tree/master/other/buttersoy-mushrooms.md).
