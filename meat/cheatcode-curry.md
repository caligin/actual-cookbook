# randomest curry

I once prepared curry boiling the beef that goes in for, like, 5 hours. using the sb golden curry thing takes, like, 5 minutes. now tell me if that's not cheating.

feeds you for at least two meals

## ingredients

- 4 smallbricks of sb golden curry
- 0.7l water
- 250g diced chicken (or your meat of choice)
- loads of butter
- 2 carrots
- 2 baby potatoes
- 1 onion

## preparation

- melt butter in a pot
- throw potato, onion and meat in it and cook them a little
- add carrot and cook everything a little more, stirring frequently
- add water
- heat up to a boil
- set to low, cover and simmer for 15
- remove from heat
- add the curry bricks and stir continously until uniform
- feel guilty for how trivial this is with the ~~cheat code~~ curry bricks
- serve

## notes

you'll need something on the side to pick up the sauce. some toasted bread works just fine.
