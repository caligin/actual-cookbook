# randomest curry

My curry is the randomest thing. I think I tried to look up a convincing recipe and then mixing 3 or 4 together. But the result is reasonably good.

Serves: 1 for an entire week, you do the math.

TODO (ingredients) I'm sure I'm missing something here. also, qualify "that dodgy stock thing".

## ingredients

- 1 can of tomatoes
- water
- (how much? 20b6? ) diced beef
- vegetable oil
- a pack of "that dodgy stock thing"
- white yogurt
- 1 onion or 2
- curry powder (I usually use rogan josh but whichever is your fav)
- 1 spn corn flour or 2

## preparation

- chop onion
- throw in pot with oil on mid-high and fry it for a min until lightly golden
- roll a beef die
- if the result is 20, spend a minute questioning geometry, the skill of the butcher who cut your meat in icosahedral shape and why would that even have numbers on the sides.
- roll all beef dice in the pot
- no, you can't use a special ability to reroll the 1s and 2s. not even if you're Mandy Thompson. those armor rolls are failed, move on and focus on not burning the curry
- cook for a couple of minutes to brown the exterior, stirring constantly to prevent sticking
- add water, tomato, "that dodgy stock thing", yogurt, curry powder
- leave on high heath until it starts boiling then turn down on low
- it will take 2~3h to reduce and thicken, stir occasionally
- at some point you will inevitably lose patience and decide to add cornflour to help it getting to the right consistency before your driving license expires
- do some guesswork to figure if it looks ready or not
- get impatient and decide that it's indeed ready
- serve

## notes

Goes great with some udon.
