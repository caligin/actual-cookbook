## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the tortellini in the water before it's boiling.

Choice of tortellini filling is yours. Tortelloni works too but they tend to get too soft before adding to the pan. Consider cooking them for slightly less than instructions to avoid sogginess.

I specified 2 spn sage assuming it dried. If you have fresh sage tear the leaves in 3-4 pieces and use that. Or chop them if you prefer.
