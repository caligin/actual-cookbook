# carbonara/apocrypha

This is my favourite carbonara variant. Texture is so much nicer than spaghetti.

Serves 1.

## ingredients

- 150g mezzi rigatoni
- 100g diced pancetta
- 2 eggs
- grated parmesan
- a pinch white pepper
- a pinch curry powder
- pepper pepper pepper
- coarse salt
- 1 coffespn oil

## preparation

- set pot of water on high heat to boil
- in the meantime heat up a pan on mid heat with a little oil
- add diced pancetta, sprinkle with just a little white pepper and curry powder
- fry until golden
- in the meantime add in a bowl 1 egg and 1 yolk, enough grated parmesan to compare to the amount of egg and enough black pepper to make it real dark, then mix
- when water boils, drop some coarse salt and pasta in the pot
- follow instructions on pasta pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
- drain pasta, put in a bowl, add sauce, add pancetta and mix well
- serve

## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.

This recipe does not scale linearly on the number of eggs. For 2 I;d probably use 1 egg and 2 yolks rather than 2 and 2. But well, adjust to taste.

If you can't find rigatoni or mezzi rigatoni and can;t decide on a replacement, the point is that it needs a shape in which the pancetta cubes can get stuck into, e.g. penne tends to be too small for this while paccheri are great. If you're one for traditions then go for spaghetti or other string-type pasta.

Bacon lardons are the same as pancetta just less fancy and more available in the uk.
