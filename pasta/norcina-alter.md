## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.

You really need fresh sausages for this, the type you get in Italy. Not easy to get your hands on, I know. Make sure that you get something that is just seasoned (salt & pepper) and with no added flavours, just good meat will become the centerpiece of the dish on its own without the need for extras.

If you're making this might as well splurge a bit on the wine too and get something nicey instead of the cheapest 100-mills bottle you can get your hands on at the coop.

Lastly, if you're up to go an extra length you can do this little ritual with the sausages before introducing the shallots in the pan: medium heat, cut the sausages along and open them in half (with the skin still on) and put them in skin side down. After a minute or so they will start curling up as the skin shrinks. Remove them from the pan, then proceed to remove skin and follow rest of recipe as normal. This will make so some extra fat from the skin stays in the pan whith the oil.
