## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.

if you have no idea what cream cheese is like I did, that's aka philadelphia. recipe calls for 200g but a standard philadelphia box is 180g and works perfectly.

overprawning (like, 300g) is perfectly fine. would suggest to lightly overcherrytomato with it too

you can replace philadelphia with double cream too, does not come out as good though and you def need to boil it a little before simmering to thicken.

you can replace pappardelle with tagliatelle if you can't find any but pappardelle are just somuchbetter
