# fried aubergine

Serves 2

## ingredients

- 200g orecchiette
- 1 aubergine
- 2 garlic cloves
- basil leaves
- parmesan
- olive oil
- coarse salt
- table salt


## preparation

- dice aubergine in ~5mm cubes
- put in a colander, salt, toss and leave to give up liquid for 1h (if you have the time, otherwise at lease 20m)
- chop garlic
- set pot of water on high heat to boil
- prepare a pan with olive oil, heat it up on high when pasta water is about to start boiling
- add garlic and cook ~30 seconds until golden
- add aubergine dices and half basil leaves, give it a good toss so it's evenly coated with oil
- leave to brown without touching too much. occasionally toss every 3-4 minutes to flip the side being browned. stop cooking if browning too much but it will likely take whole pasta cooking time
- when water boils, drop some coarse salt and orecchiette in the pot
- follow instructions on pasta pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
- reserve a couple ladlefuls of pasta cooking water
- drain pasta, add to the aubergine pan, add a ladleful (or more as needed) of cooking water and toss
- let sauce thicken
- serve
- top with remaining basil leaves and parmesan

## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.
