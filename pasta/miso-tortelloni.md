# miso tortelloni

At some point I bought a box of miso because it's delicious, only to realize that actually I have no idea what to use it for. And I often don't have the patience for marinades, that is a common use afaik. Then there was a "let's co-co-combo fridge leftovers" day and this happened. Turns out to be quite good, unlike how it sounds.

Serves 2.

## ingredients

- 250g tortelloni
- 2 garlic cloves
- a cube of butter (~10g)
- 1 spn mirin
- 1 spn sake
- 1 coffeespn soysauce
- 2 spn miso paste
- some water (~50 ml)
- Â½ coffeespn corn flour/corn starch (whichever you call it)

## preparation

- chop garlic fine
- set pot of water on high heat to boil
- dissolve cornstarch in water (not the one in the pot -- that's for the tortelloni), I'll refer to this as cornwater
- set pan at mid heat and melt butter
- throw sake, soy sauce, mirin, miso in the pan
- add enough cornwater to dissolve the miso to the pan and stir until dissolved
- set heat to low and leave a few minutes on a light boil to thicken
- when water boils, drop some coarse salt and tortelloni in the pot
- follow instructions on tortelloni pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
- drain tortelloni, put in a bowl, pour sauce over them and mix well
- profit!

## notes

Do not, under any circumstances, add the tortelloni in the water before it's boiling.

My go-to tortelloni are the chorizo-filled you can find in uk's tescos (yes, I didn't expect it but chorizo and miso go fairly well together) but use whichever filling you like the most. Or tortellini. Or cappelletti. or whatever you feel like.

If your pan is big enough, you can pour the drained tortelloni in the pan with sauce and give them a stir while still on low heat instead of using a bowl. Not sure it makes much difference but feels fancier.
