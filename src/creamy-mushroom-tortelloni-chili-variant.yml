  Variation on the creamy mushroom tortelloni, with chili as the type parameter.

  Serves 2.

preparation: |
  - chop garlic fine
  - remove stem from mushrooms and slice them
  - set pot of water on high heat to boil
  - set pan at mid heat, add chili oil and melt butter
  - have a spoonful of chili oil for yourself because it's delicious
  - add garlic, mushrooms and a sprinkle of pepper
  - cook until browned (mushrooms will first absorb all the butter then release some juices -- at that point they're pretty much done)
  - add cream and set heat to low
  - sprinkle some extra pepper for maximum pepper freshness
  - stir frequently making sure that the cream doesn't stick, cook for ~2-3 mins, just enough to have the cream thicken a little
  - when water boils, drop some coarse salt and tortelloni in the pot
  - follow instructions on tortelloni pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
  - drain tortelloni, put in a bowl, pour sauce over them and mix well
  - profit!

notes: |
  Do not, under any circumstances, add the tortelloni in the water before it's boiling.

  My go-to tortelloni are the chorizo-filled you can find in uk's tescos but use whichever filling you like the most. Or tortellini. Or cappelletti. or whatever you feel like.

  If your pan is big enough, you can pour the drained tortelloni in the pan with sauce and give them a stir while still on low heat instead of using a bowl. Not sure it makes much difference but feels fancier.

  It's probably worth deglazing the pan with something clear like vodka before adding the cream, I've not tried yet. I tried with bourbon and found that it doesn't really go well with chili imho.
