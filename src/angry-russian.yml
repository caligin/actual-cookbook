  White russian, but with foamy milk.
  
  ## tools
  
  - shaker
  - jigger for the measures
  - strainer
preparation: |
  Throw kalhua, vodka and ice in a glass (old fahioned glass works best)
  
  Throw milk in shaker with ice and shake angrily. After a while some milk will still be liquid and not foamy, use the strainer to pour it in a second container/glass, then remove the strainer and slowly pour the foamy milk in the glass. If it has the right consistency it will layer effortlessly. Optionally repeat shaking with the remaining milk.  
ingredients:
  - 1 sjig kalhua
  - 1 bjig vodka (russian standard is my go-to one)
  - 2 sjig milk (not sure which one, I think the one that linges in the fridge is uk's "blue" one, whatever that means)
  - ice
notes: |
  Don't forget to remove the milk that is still liquid before pouring or it will ruin the layering
