  Ideally a norcina, but if all you can find is british breakfast sausage we're quite far from the desired result.
  
  Serves 2.

preparation: |
  - chop onion fine
  - remove skin from sausages and shred in small pieces (it's probably easier with your hands than with a knife)
  - set pot of water on high heat to boil
  - set pan at mid heat and melt butter
  - add onion and fry for a minute or two until lightly golden
  - add sausage, a generous sprinkle of rosemary and a sprinkle of pepper
  - cook until browned
  - deglaze pan with a gulp of white wine
  - add cream and set heat to low
  - sprinkle some extra pepper for maximum pepper freshness
  - stir frequently making sure that the cream doesn't stick, cook for ~2-3 mins, just enough to have the cream thicken a little
  - when water boils, drop some coarse salt and penne in the pot
  - follow instructions on pasta pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
  - drain pasta, put in a bowl, pour sauce over it and mix well
  - serve
  
ingredients:
  - 150g penne
  - 100g firm sausage
  - 150ml double cream
  - half an onion
  - 1 coffeespn rosemary or 2
  - a cube of butter (~10g)
  - white wine
  - pepper pepper pepper
  - coarse salt
notes: |
  Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.
  
  Afaik penne is the traditional type of pasta to use with this but any type would do. Fusilli work pretty well.
  
  So, about the sausages. You ideally want something firm and savory with a decent amount of fat.  Unfortunately in the uk most if not all the sausages availabe at a supermarket is this british breakfast thing that is more similar to a pork paste. If you can find some decent sausages at your local buthcher then that's great, otherwise the closest thing I could get my hands on is the pork chipotlas from tesco's. They look the same as other sausages but are less liquid, that at least helps with shredding them.
