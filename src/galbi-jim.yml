  2 -3 people.
  
  ### cooking time 
  2 hours (including prep)

preparation: |
  Pre-soak the shitake in advance and keep the water for the sauce. Remove the stems from the shitake and cut into halves or quarters depending on the size.
  
  Mix the mirin, soy sauce, shitake water, gochugaru, sugar, black pepper, ginger and garlic to form the sauce base.
  
  Boil the short ribs for 10 mins in boiling water to purge the impurities. Drain and rinse the short ribs in cold water to get rid of any excess blood and bone shards.
  
  Return the ribs back into your pot (we use a dutch oven for braising) and add the sauce base. Ensure the liquid covers your short ribs, too little sauce and you run the risk of your ribs drying out.
  
  Cook the ribs on high heat for 30 mins, stir ribs occasionally so they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Turn the heat down to a simmer for another 30 mins.
  
  Add the potatoes/radish/carrots to the ribs and simmer for another 30 mins. Then add the onions and simmer for another 10 mins. Check your ribs are fall off the bone tender - if its still tough let the braise go on for longer.
  
  Top with spring onions and chilli for garnish. Serve with rice and kimchi.
