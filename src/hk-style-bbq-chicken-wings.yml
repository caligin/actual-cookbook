  we're trying hard to recreate a recipe, here are the ingredients that should go in it
preparation: |
  grate/crush/mince/pasteify ginger and garlic.
  throw all ingredients in a bowl, give the meat a good toss and massage to spread the marinade evenly and let sit in the fridge for at least 30m, better overnight.

  throw on a mid-high bbq. time depends on hotness of bbq, presence of lidding devices, thickness of wings, wind speed and weather forecast for the rest of the week...
  or but about 7 minutes per side.
ingredients:
  - 8 chicken wings
  - ginger
  - garlic
  - chinese rose wine (玫瑰露酒)
  - white pepper
  - salt
  - soy sauce
notes: |
  no idea what the correct quantities are!

  if you (like us) can't find the rose wine, shaoxing wine works too although it's almost a whole different recipe with that substitution
