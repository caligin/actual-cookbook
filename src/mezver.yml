  like a versper, but mezcal
preparation: |
  stir, garnish with grapefruit twist expressing oils

  20 kina 50 wybo 50 danger don garnish grapefruit (still heavy on mezcal tbh) but grapefruit wins (serves 2)
ACTUALLY GOING 60WY 40MEZ IS BETTER
ingredients:
  - 45ml vodka
  - 30ml mezcal
  - 15ml kina l'areo d'or
notes: |
  yes, unlike a vesper there's more vodka than base spirit - found out that it balances better like this with a mezcal that is more aromatic than smoky.
  these ratios are with a wyborova vodka and dangerous don mezcal, using something smokier mezcal might need adjustment (or consider not doing this at all).
