  without bone is fine, cooking time for a ~600g chunk was less than 1.5 hour
  recommended to use higher heat with grill first to give it a little crust then lower temp and cover with foil after ~15-20m
  
  replace all mint with powdered paprika and harissa instead
  
  replace mint in salsa verde with some green peppercorn in brine (if you have any)
