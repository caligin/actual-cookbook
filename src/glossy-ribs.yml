  TODO refine, this is a quick reference in ml instead of us units

preparation: |
  todo --  but the tl;dr is use salt to season ribs, mix everything else, coat and marinade for 1h
  
ingredients:
  - 1.4kg baby back ribs
  - 120ml rice vinegar
  - 3spn worchestershire sauce
  - 240ml maple syrup
  - 180ml dijon mustard
  - 160ml gochujang
  - flake salt
notes: |
  recipe calls for chopping the ribs in halves but if you don't I used a quarted of the amounts for 700g ribs and that was plenty
