  Refer to *double greasy special* and *double greasy turbo*. If you can't decide between carrots and mushrooms, well, thenâ€¦

  **WHY NOT BOTH?**

  Serves 1.

  ## tools

  - pan with lid

preparation: |
  - dice onion
  - dice carrot
  - remove stem of mushrooms and dice them
  - chop garlic fine
  - pour a big drop of oil in the pan, set fire on mid and melt the butter with the oil
  - throw all veggies in, sprinkle with a little curry powder and black pepper
  - give it just a quick stir and flip to absorb the oil/butter
  - distribute the veggies evenly in the pan
  - lay the patties on top of the veggies and close lid
  - cook until it looks like they're mostly cooked, stirring from time to time to prevent the veggies to stick
  - by that time the veggies should be golden brown too
  - flip the burgers, this time with direct contact on the surface of the pan
  - close lid and cook for a few more minutes
  - add some peppercorns on the patties, then move the veggies on top and seal with a slice of cheese
  - close lid again, set flame to low and wait a minute for the cheese to melt
  - move to a plate and pour the grease remaining in the pan on top of the cheese
  
ingredients:
  - 2 burger patties (beef works best)
  - 1 onion
  - 1/2 carrot
  - 4 chestnut mushrooms
  - 2 cheese slices (the cheap melty one sold in slices that actually doesn't have much flavour)
  - black peppercorns
  - curry powder (rogan josh or similar is my fav)
  - black pepper (crushed)
  - oil
  - a cube of butter butter
  - 2 cloves of garlic
notes: |
  You can dust the patties in flour for maximum grease retention.

  I generally cut an X incision on both sides of the patty to make sure it comes out well done. I seem to understand that a well-done burger is often considered heresy but I often end up freezing patties sometimes even for long so well done it is, just to be on the safe side.

  Yep, I didn't forget about it, no bread!

  The dicing instead of using the cuts described in the other two recipes is because my pan barely fits everything at once so dicing makes it easier to move stuff around and defrag available space. Beware of dicing too fine though, it burns right away otherwise!
