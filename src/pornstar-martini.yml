  it's not funny, it's delicious. or rather, it's so delicious it's not even funny. recipe adjusted from [crafty bartending](https://craftybartending.com/cocktail-recipes/porn-star-martini/)

preparation: |
  mix vodka, passoa, syrup, lime juice and juice and pulp of 1 passionfruit in a shaker with ice. double strain in chilled martini or coupe glass. serve shot of champagne on side.
  
ingredients:
  - 45ml vodka
  - 15ml passoa
  - 15ml vanilla syrup
  - 15ml lime juice
  - 1 passionfruit
  - 30ml champagne
notes: |
  lime yield calls for roughly half a lime. if you want to be fancy a.f. you can float half a hollowed passionfruit and pour the champagne inside it.
  
  any other sparkling wine would do in absence of chapagne but would recommend a cremont or brut over a prosecco (although I'm biased and not a fan of prosecco)
  
  original recipe calls for vanilla vodka but tbh I'd rather go for plain vodka instead. russian standard and lone wolf work beutifully.
