  I searched everywhere in london for *days* before realizing that this is actually made with pecorino romano and not "a specific cheese called cacio" (I did find something called cacioscamorza though, that is very nice but also doesn't have the right consistency for this dish).

  Serves one or more people depending on how much ingredients you want to use

preparation: |
  - set pot of water on high heat to boil
  - grate cheese fine and mix toroughly with a little cold water to make a cream
  - add pepper and mix again
  - when water boils, drop some coarse salt and pasta in the pot
  - cook pasta to instructions then strain and quickly throw in the sauce while still hot
  - toss to coat, leave for a minute so that the heat from pasta makes the cheese stick
  
ingredients:
  - pecorino romano
  - spaghetti
  - pepper pepper pepper
  - pepper pepper pepper
  - pepper pepper pepper
notes: |
  Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.

  I see a lot of recipes calling for doing fancy stuff with pasta's cooking water but a chef friend of mine tells me that he does with just cold water so I'll just go by that for now

  lotsa other videos around the interwebz toast the pepper before adding it, saying that it gets nicer flavour. afaik toasting pepper makes it lose flavour rather than enhancing so fuck that, just make sure that you crush it fresh. ofc idk really so if you can prove me wrong please do so.

  if you can't find pecorino romano this recipe works fine with a replacement cheese that is aged and firm and kinda similar flavour but only as long as you don't go around telling anyone. admitting cheese replacement in the wrong neighborhood can cause severe injury, loss of conciousness and death.

  I routinely fail at making this in a decent way (and I also never had one done professionally so I have no comparison either) so take whatever I write here with a (massive) pinch of (coarse) salt
