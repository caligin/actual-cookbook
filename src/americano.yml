  I like the ratios from [Difford's](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/61/americano) for this one. I'm particular with the booze-to-soda ratio and this works well.
preparation: |
  build in tall glass filled with ice. add campari and vermouth first, stir to chill and dilute. top with soda water, give a gentle stir to combine without loosing too much fizz.
ingredients:
  - 45ml campari
  - 45ml sweet vermouth
  - 75ml soda water
  - orange slice for garnish
