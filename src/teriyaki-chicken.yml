  Serves 1.
  
  ## tools
  
  - aluminium foil

preparation: |
  - heat a gulp of vegetable oil very hot (enough oil to barely cover the whole surface of the pan works yoi)
  - add chicken skin side dow
  - apply salt and white pepper on top of chicken
  - turn heat down to mid-low
  - cover chicken with foil and cook for ~7 min
  - flip and cook on flesh side ~3 min (keeping covered with foil)
  - add sake and turn to high heat to deglaze
  - once alcohol is consumed turn down heat again and add teriyaki sauce
  - have the teriyaki thicken while tilting the pan/moving chicken around to absorb the sauce on all sides **except skin** so it stays crispy
  - it's ready when the sauce looks sticky-ish (usually just a few minutes)
  - get off pan, leave rest for a couple of minutes covered with foil
  - slice every thigh in 3 pieces
  
ingredients:
  - 2 boneless chicken thighs
  - vegetable oil
  - salt
  - white pepper
  - 2 spn sake
  - 3 spn teriyaki sauce
notes: |
  If you can't find boneless thighs with the skin on get thighs with bone and debone them yourself. It's annoying but [Chef Dai has a cool tutorial on how to cut that bone away more efficiently](https://youtu.be/r0IEiU_-Fjo). I don;t recommend giving up on the skin.
  
  I pour a random amount of sake directly from the bottle. The spannometric amount is "a couple of gulps so it distributes evenly around the circumference of the pan".
  
  Similarly for the teriyaki sauce, from the pan where I prepare it, "enough to have a thin uniform layer on the whole surface of the pan".
