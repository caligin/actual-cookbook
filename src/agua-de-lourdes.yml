  aka the flatfish moisturiser.

  make this in a squeezy bottle and use liberally when cooking big flatfish on a bbq, like a brill or turbot.

  the real deal is used in a famous turbot resaurant in spain - I have no idea what's in the og one or whether this is even close but the intended usage is the same.
preparation: |
  pour in a squeezy bottle, shake vigorously to emulsify. reshake before each use.
ingredients:
  - 15g salt
  - 60g rice vinegar
  - 15g moscatel vinegar
  - 40g extra virgin olive oil
