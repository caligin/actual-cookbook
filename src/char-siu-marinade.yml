  See the char siu recipe in the meat section, here's just the sauce.
  
  I couldn't find all the necessary ingredients easily and couln't be asked to go all the way to Chinatown to find them so the ingredients listing includes my replacements.
  
  Enough for: cooking a round of char siu of about ~500g plus some leftover to brush on burgers
