  My friend Pascul's variant on a norcina.

  Preparing less than the given amount at a time is not considered acceptable for this recipe.

  Serves 2 for an entire day, or 4 for a single meal.

preparation: |
  - remove skin from sausages and shred in small pieces (it's probably easier with your hands than with a knife)
  - set pot of water on high heat to boil
  - set pan at mid heat with olive oil
  - add sausage, 1 spn of rosemary and a sprinkle of pepper
  - cook until browned
  - add cream and set heat to low
  - sprinkle some extra pepper for maximum pepper freshness and the rest of rosemary
  - stir frequently making sure that the cream doesn't stick, cook for ~2-3 mins, just enough to have the cream thicken a little
  - when water boils, drop some coarse salt and orecchiette in the pot
  - follow instructions on pasta pack for how long it takes to cook, stir occasionally
  - drain pasta, put in a bowl, pour sauce over it and mix well
  - serve
  
ingredients:
  - 500g orecchiette
  - 250g firm sausage
  - 300ml double cream
  - 3 spn rosemary
  - 2 spn olive oil
  - pepper pepper pepper
  - coarse salt
notes: |
  Do not, under any circumstances, add the pasta in the water before it's boiling.

  This *has* to be done with orecchiette (I know, they're ridiculously hard to find! Even in italy tbh). And a good sausage (see notes in the notcina recipe). If you can't get your hands on either refer to the notcina recipe instead. This is an all-or-nothing.
