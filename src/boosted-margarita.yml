  A take on Margarita with some stronger flavours

  ## tools

  - shaker
  - jigger for the measures
  - strainer

preparation: |
  after squeezing limes, use remaining peel to rim the glass rind so that salt can stick to it. pour some salt on a flat surface and roll the glass over it to get the salt attached.

  add everything in a shaker with ice, shake, strain in the glasses.
  
ingredients:
  - 60ml reposado tequila
  - 30ml lime juice
  - 15ml triple sec
  - 15ml simple syrup
  - 1 half lime slice for garnish
  - flake salt
  - ice
notes: |
  30ml lime juice is approx 1 lime, littleless. Would recommend to put extra lime than less lime (so like for 2 people instead of 2 limes go 2.5 or even 3).

  a double strain is recommended if you have a second, finer strainer

  simple syrup can be replaced with maple syrup for a funny aftertaste addition

  if you want to morph it to a long drink, ginger beer is the way to go
