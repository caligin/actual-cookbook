  as seen on [cocktail chemistry](https://youtu.be/JjW8-sBejm0), noted down here for quick access.

preparation: |
  add ground coffee and 300ml water in a mason jar. shake and store in fridge overnight (this makes the cold brew).
  bring 240ml of water to a simmer, dissolve brown sugar in it (this makes the sugar syrup).
  strain cold coffee brew in a bottle, then add sugar syrup, vanilla extract and rum and shake.
  
ingredients:
  - 40g ground espresso coffee
  - 540ml water
  - 500ml dark rum
  - 200g dark brown sugar
  - 1 spn vanilla extract
notes: |
  first run of recipe used light brown sugar and 20g ground coffee. result is delicious but light in colour and a bit lacking on the coffee character. hypotesis is that 40g coffee for the cold brew and using dark brown sugar would give it the missing touches. experimet and pr as necessary.

  I love using a [gordon street's black forest roast](https://www.gordonstcoffee.co.uk/product/black-forest-roast/) for this. for reference first run of recipe used a havana 7 as base rum.
