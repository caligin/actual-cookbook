  With my cast iron pan and electric hobs these little bastards are tricky af to make. but well, the deliciousness kinda pays off.

  using the granulated dashi from japan center 1 portion is too much for 350ml water. it's so strong it overpowers everything. go for 1:700ml and it should be alright.

  the pan needs to be very greasy beforehand, well preheated and kept at a steady mid-temperature (5/10 on my electric hobs).

  still, needs loads of patience.

  I can't stress enough how important it is to grease the pan well beforehand, if it's even a little dry the little bastards will self-destruct as you try to flip them.
