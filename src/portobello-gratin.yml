  massive mushrooms and cheese curls. what can possibly go wrong?

preparation: |
  crush/chop garlic
  
  preheat oven with grill at ~250
  
  melt butter in a pan (griddle pan's even better) and cook mushrooms until butter absorbed and mushroom softened. flip as needed. move to baking tray with cap down, season with salt and pepper pepper pepper, fill with garlic, generous dose of grated gruvyere and top with thin layer of grated parmesan.
  
  throw in oven and bake for ~2 minutes to melt and crisp cheese (keep an eye on it, it takes seconds to move from cripy to charcoal)
  
ingredients:
  - big portobello mushrooms
  - gruvyere cheese
  - parmesan
  - butter
  - garlic
  - salt
  - pepper pepper pepper
notes: |
  can replace gruvyere with whatever.
  
  not sure that the trick with parmesan makes really a difference.
  
  I tested the recipe getting the oven part wrong so it was 200grill so the 250grill is hypotetical until proved right. 200 was not enough to make cheese crispy.
