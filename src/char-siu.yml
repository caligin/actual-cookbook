  From [CHAR SIU RECIPE - MELT IN YOUR MOUTH CHINESE BBQ PORK](https://youtu.be/c0ICMcuhdPg).
  
  I couldn't find all the necessary ingredients easily and couln't be asked to go all the way to Chinatown to find them so the ingredients listing includes my replacements.
  
  Serves *some*, depending on how much pork you get.
  
  ## tools
  
  - sealable plastic bag
  - cooking brush

preparation: |
  - mix everything (except the pork)
  - put pork in plastic bag
  - pour mix in bag
  - use bowl of water to get rid of air
  - massage to have the meat covered in sauce uniformly
  - leave in fridge overnight
  - add some cornflour in the bag and massage to even out
  - place pork on oven tray with some foil and pour the remainder sauce in a bowl
  - bake for ~120 min at 200C flipping over every 10 min
  - after the first two turns start brushing the sauce on the surface everytime you flip
  - slice it up in thin-ish slices and serve. goes well as a snack.
  
ingredients:
  - \*some* pork belly
  - 4 spn honey
  - 2 spn light soy sauce
  - 1 spn mirin
  - 1 spn loganma crispy chilli oil
  - 1 spn oyster sauce
  - 1 spn hoisin sauce
  - 1/2 coffeespn five spices
  - 2 tsp of dark soy sauce
  - 1 spn some random indian paprika I found in the cupboard
  - 1-2 spn corn flour/corn starch (whichever you call it)
notes: |
  Might take more or less baking time depending on the thickness. Took me so long because I cut a big piece of belly unevenly and one slice was way thicker than the other.
  
  If you get leftover sauce it goes well brushed on an herrburger. Or on a burger in general.
  
  Brush is actually optional, you can do with a spoon tbh but it helps loads to make the coating even even on the sides.
