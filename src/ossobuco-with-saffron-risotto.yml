  sucking on the bone marrow is such a luxurious experience.

  this recipe is a mashup taking inspirations from a few others: [Babish's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9Is6NsFck), [one from Giallozafferano](https://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Ossibuchi-alla-milanese.html) and the risotto is from [this other one](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/pigeon-saffron-risotto-recipe).
  I prefer the thing without tomato, especially if served with risotto.
preparation: |
  # for the ossobuco

  chop onion, 1 shallot, cerely, carrot, 2 cloves of garlic fine (or pulse in a food processor). mix flour with abundant salt and pepper and dust the ossibuchi well, pat off the excess.

  set a dutch oven on medium high. add some olive oil and melt 25g butter on it. add ossibuchi and leave untouched for 3-4 minutes to develop some crust. repeat on other side. pour a gulp or 2 of white wine, let evaporate then remove meat and set aside.

  add the veg and cook on medium until browned. drop a gulp or two of white wine. return the meat to the dutch oven, add an extra bone marrow and cover with beef stock. set on low, cover, cook for 35m, flip, 25m more.
  remove lid, keep cooking until sauce reduced to desired levels, about 15 more minutes or whatever makes you happy.

  extract the extra marrow, chop fine and use in the risotto

  # for the gremolata

  chop parsley fine, grate 1 clove of garlic, zest half lemon. mix by hand, use to top the dish at the end.

  # for the risotto

  chop 1 shallot fine. set a pan with olive oil on medium, add shallot to sweat for a few minutes until golden. add rice and few pinches of salt and cook for 1 more minute until translucent. add some generous gulps of white wine and let absorb.
  add half the saffron and start adding in stock, a little at a time, waiting until absorbed until adding more. after 10 minutes add the rest of saffron. continue until rice gets to the desired consistency, likely about 30 minutes total. you will likely have spare stock.

  remove from heat and stir in 20g butter, pecorino and the extra marrow cooked with the ossobuco.

  plate risotto first, put an ossobuco on top of it, then pour some ossobuco sauce all over and top with gremolata.
