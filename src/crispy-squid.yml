  scouring and cutting in bigger chunks recommended as it will take the batter on better, it was slipping off

  do pat dry before dipping or the water will make explosive oil bubbles on the 170 round

  try to do only 1 round at 170 maybe? suspect that a double fly is not necessary

  don't use too much oil on the veg or they will be soggy for a while before you manage to make it crispy
