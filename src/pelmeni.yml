  From: [How to make Russian pelmeni - Cooking with Boris](https://youtu.be/YO7AdLsUSec)

  Basically small chebureki. And not deep fried.

  Serves: me 4 or 5 times

preparation: |
  ### filling

  - chop the onion coarsely
  - mince garlic
  - combine mince, chopped onion, 1cspn salt, pepper in a bowl
  - mix with your hands
  - cover and let sit while you prepare the shells

  ### shells

  - combine flour, 1cspn salt, egg, water in a bowl
  - mix to form dough
  - knead until it's uniform enough
  - use a rolling pin to flatten, then some with a round mold like a glass to cut circular shapes out of the flattened dough

  ### kombine

  - get a pot of water with some salt to a boil
  - put a spoonful of filling in middle of a shell and fold, then use press on the edges to seal the pelmen and fold the edges inwards
  - boil in batches for 7m
  - serve with some fresh dill (if you have it) and plenty of mayonez
  
ingredients:
  - 250g *pork* mince
  - 1 garlic clove
  - 1/2 onion
  - 2 1cspn salt
  - 1spn pepper
  - 1 egg
  - 200ml water
  - 300g flour
notes: |
  Works better with pork mince or a mix that is mainly pork. Actually, don't even try to use beef, it's not great and does not go that well with either the seasonings nor mayonez.

  Well suited to last long in the freezer and serve as emergency rations.
