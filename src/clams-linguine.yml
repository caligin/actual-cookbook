  recipe taken from [BA's Best Linguine and Clams](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-linguine-and-clams)

preparation: |
  scrub clams then leave them in a bowl with salty water for at least 30m to purge.

  heat up 2spn olive oil in a duch oven over medium, add 3 garlic cloves chopped fine and breadcrumbs and brown until crisp, stirring often. remove from pan and add flaky salt and lemon zest. wipe the dutch oven.

  heat remaining oil in a duch oven over medium, cook sliced garlic until golden at edges. add anchovies and red pepperflakes and cook until golden and anchovy is dissolved. add wine and simmer until reduced to a couple of spoons. add clams and toss to coat. cover and cook until clams are open, about 5 minutes (check & cook more if not open yet). transfer clams in a bowl leaving sauce in the dutch, cover with foil.

  cook pasta halfway through, then transfer 240ml pasta water and pasta to dutch oven with sauce. cook until pasta is al dente and sauce looks glossy and thick.

  remove from heat. add parsley, butter and a third of breadcrumbs and toss to melt butter. plate and top with clams, more breadcrumb mixture, more pepper/salt and a drizzle of oil.

notes: |
  I actually used pappardelle instead of linguine. I really like how they absorb the sauce tbh.

  amout of breadcrums and parsley is very approximative, I go by eye. similar for clams: I asked "enough for a meal for 3" to the fishmonger and went with what he gave me. might have been 1kg, not really sure (the above amounts refer to a meal for 2 though).
