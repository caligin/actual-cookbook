  White russian, but with [crema de cerveza](https://mrquijote.com/producto/licor-crema-de-cerveza/).

  add coffee liqueur and vodka straight in a rocks glass with a big chunk of ice. give it a little stir. add milk, crema de cerveza and 2 cubes of ice to a shaker and shake heavily until ice almost dissolved. strain with a hawthorne strainer on top of ice chunk to layer.
  
ingredients:
  - 15ml coffee liqueur
  - 30ml vodka
  - 15ml whole milk
  - 15ml crema de cerveza
