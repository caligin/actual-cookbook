# ideas: embed other recipe (e.g. when something has a sauce that can be considered a thing on its own)
# ideas: ref to ingredient but allow name also - that allows to e.g. say whisky referring to the type of ingredients but also specifying a specific preferred thing
# ideas: ref to ingredient and default the unit from it (maybe can use yml references for it?)
# ideas: fmt binary. allows to write ingredients like - 40ml something - 20 blah and it converts in longhand structure so avoid having to type everything out. OR - processor supports no-fields option
