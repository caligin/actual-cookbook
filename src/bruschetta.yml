  quick, garlicky, refreshing.

  makes 12 bruschette (that feeds 2 bruschetta fans or up to 6 people if it's for a snack)

preparation: |
  preheat oven at 160C top grill + fan assisted. slice bread ~1.5cm thick. dice tomatoes in ~.5cm pieces.

  grill bread slices in almost-top rack of the oven for 4m, flip, repeat for 3m. rub garlic on bread (should be crispy and consume the garlic as you rub it as if it was chalk on a rock). drizzle generously with oil. top with tomato, oregano, salt, pepper, more more quick oil drizzle on top of tomato.

  grill in oven for 3m (tomato should start drying on the edges and not be too moist anymore, leave 1 more minute if not). top with basil leaves and flaky salt and serve.
