  Sweet, spicy, funky fried fish. 
preparation: |

    For the Roasted rice powder, dry toast raw sticky rice in a pan over a low heat until golden brown and let it cool. Grind in a pestle and mortar until you get a fine powder.
    
    Pre-heat deep fryer to 180C. 
    
    Prep all the ingredients for the topping and add to bowl - except the roasted rice powder and fried chillies.

    Score the fish with three to four angled cuts on each side. Then roll it in the light soy sauce and white sugar. 
    
    Place the fish in the deep fry basket so it curls slightly and deep fry it for about 8-10 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the flesh is a deep golden brown.
    
    Make the dressing by mixing together the lime juice and sugar until the sugar dissolves, add fish sauce, water and chilli powder.
    
    Remove fish from fryer and allow to cool a bit on kitchen paper.
    
    Mix 2/3 of the dressing to the topping and mix.

    Serve the fish on a large plate, pour 1/3 of the dressing over it.

    Garnish with the topping, roasted rice powder and dried chillies.
