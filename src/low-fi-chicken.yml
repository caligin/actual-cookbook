  For when I planned to make karaage but then decided that I can't be bothered to fillet the chicken and wait for the marinade to settle.

  Serves probably 2

  ## ingredients

  core:
  - 4-5 chicken thighs
  - pepper pepper pepper
  - salt
  - 1 spn vegetable oil

  not-karaage plugin:
  - 1 spn soy sauce
  - 1 spn sake
  - 1 coffespn sesame oil
  - 2 garlic cloves
  - some ginger (equivalent in ginger of 2 garlic cloves)

preparation: |
  - [plugin-only step] chop or grate ginger and garlic 
  - mix with all other ingredients in a bowl as if preparing a marinade
  - [plugin-only step] stop thinking if you should actually go one step further, wait for the marinade and prepare karaage instead
  - [plugin-only step] realize that it's not de-bone o'clock
  - [plugin-only step] give up
  - preheat oven, upper grill settings at 200C (or set to broil if your oven has a broiler)
  - place chicken on a grill so that juice drips and can be collected in a tray
  - cook ~20 min, midway through flip it and try to ladle the juices collected in the tray over it again

notes: |
  This actually sounds reasonably not low-fi because of the not-karaage plugin but point is: you can go as low-fi as just some salt, pepper and oil and add whatever spice you like/have available in your kitchen.

  Just make sure that you broil the chicken istead of throwing it into the over with default settings (like, tray ad mid-height with both grills ventilated) or it will take ages to cook and won't be much crispy.
