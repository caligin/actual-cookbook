description: |
  discovered by mistake experimenting, this combination is similar enough to a mezcal that I would't be offended by having it as a replacement in a cocktail.
preparation: |
  mix.
ingredients:
  - 10ml smoky whisky
  - 10ml vodka
  - 10ml tequila reposado
notes: |
  ingredients given as 10ml but this scales 1:1:1 so whatever your target need of mezcal is /3.
