  From?

  Brewdog Camden used to serve some chorizo scotch eggs that are absolutely delicious so I tried to make them at home adapting some recipe I forgot about.

  Conclusions: preparing scotch eggs can be long and messy, I'm not entirely sure I'm up for doing it again anytime soon.

preparation: |
  - soft-boil egg (6 min in boiling water then put in ice bath)
  - chop chorizo fine and try not to get mad
  - same with cheese
  - mix chorizo with cheese and pork until uniform-ish
  - use the mix to make a meatball around the softboiled egg
  - dust with flour
  - coat in egg
  - coat in breadcrumbs
  - repeat the two steps above for a thicker coating
  - deep fry until browned
  - dry and keep in fridge overnight
  - serve cold and with a side with some good mustard with grains
  
ingredients:
  - (how much?) sausages (I think I used cumberland but pork chipotlas are probs better. Might try with mince instead of sausages next time).
  - 1 egg to softboil
  - more egg for the breading (1 should be enough for covering ~4)
  - some chorizo
  - some cheese (1 slice of cheddar methinks?)
  - flour
  - breadcrumbs
  - vegetable oil
notes: |
  So when I did this I got some very firm chorizo so chopping it was an absolute nightmare. If you can get your hands on some soft chorizo go for it.

  TODO find quantities and frying temp/time and I think something else is missing too
