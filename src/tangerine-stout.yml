  ## tools
  
  - brewing kit
  - moka (sized for 3 servings)

preparation: |
  see page 128 for the beer procedure.
  
  Zest the skin of 3 tangerines and use the zest to load a moka. Set it up as if you were preparing coffee, let it cool down then add in the fermenter together with wort.
  
ingredients:
  - TODO same for hindin's chocolate stout
  - 3 tangerines
notes: |
  Steaming the zest this way takes the flavour out and keeps the oils in the filer so you can get rid of some elements that don't play well with your batch. Note that the moka will complete steaming much much faster than coffee so keep an eye on it.
  
  TODO finish writing the base procedure for stout
