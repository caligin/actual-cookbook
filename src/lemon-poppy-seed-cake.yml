  ## Lemon Glaze
  - 60ml lemon juice
  - 50g sugar

preparation: |
  Preheat oven to 160C (fan assisted oven).

  Use butter or oil to grease the loaf tin and coat inside evenly with flour.

  Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, poppy seeds and lemon zest.

  In a separate bowl cream the butter with sugar and add eggs one at a time. Then add in vanilla extract and oil.

  Gradually add flour mixture alternating with splash of milk between each heap of flour.

  Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf tin.

  Bake for 40 - 50 minutes hour until wooden chopstick/skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

  Prepare the lemon glaze when the loaf is cooling. Dissolve the sugar in lemon juice over low heat.

  Use a skewer to poke the cake all over the top of the loaf and brush the lemon glaze over the warm cake.
