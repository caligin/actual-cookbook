  There are many ways to prepare this and everything is legit as long as it looks like a mana potion. This is the recipe that I prefer atm.
  
  ## tools
  
  - shaker
  - jigger for the measures

preparation: |
  Acquire alchemy skill. Farm/buy materials to level it up to at least level 375 (this can take several years).
  
  Throw all ingredients in the shaker and give it some violence.
  
  I think it should be served in a martini glass but I don't have any so I use a brewdog tasting glass instead (looks like a wine tasting glass but very small).
  
ingredients:
  - 1 bjig blue curacao
  - 1 bjig vodka (used the lone wolf one for this but russian standard works perfectly too)
  - 1 bjig lemon juice
  - ice
notes: |
  You can technically prepare this without alchemy skill but you'll end up with something that is just a nice drink and doesn't actually refill any mana.
