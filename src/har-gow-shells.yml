  recipe for the shells of har gow.
  
  ## tools
  
  - cling film
  - large flat knife
  - oil

preparation: |
  - set aside ~17g wheat starch for later
  - mix the rest of wheat starch and potato starch
  - add boiling water, mix roughly with chopsticks
  - at this point there will be a lumpy pile of translucent chunks in the middle sorrounded by starch still powdery. this is correct, cover with some cling film and let rest 3 minutes
  - add rest of wheat starch and start kneading with your hands
  - knead for approx 5m+
  - roll in a fat sausage and cover to keep the moisture while you start forming the shells
  - to form a shell, grab a piece to form a ~2cm diameter ball, then flatten to a circle shape with the flat of your knife. oil knife (and maybe surface as well so it doesn't stick). then use the knife to scrape the shell from surface
  - fill with tasty things in the middle, fold and press with your fingers to seal. there's a specific traditional way of doing this but idk how to explain it tbh
  
ingredients:
  - 100g wheat starch
  - 17g potato starch
  - 100ml boiling water
notes: |
  getting it right takes a lot of patience and flattening technique so if you can, buy these made.
  
  when I tried this I kneaded for only a couple of minutes: it had the right consistency when molding the shells, flavour and looks but the consistency didn't hold after cooking. I suspect that the main reason was not kneading enough so keep at it for at least food 5 min.
  
  also, I forgot to add the starch in 2 rounds and had to add a little bit more afterwards, have no idea whether doing it right also makes the amount right too
  
  this makes enough shells for a filling batch made from ~300g of shrimps
