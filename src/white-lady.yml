preparation: |
  mix all ingredients in a shaker without ice. long shake to foam (30-45s). add ice to shaker. shake to dilute and chill (20s). double strain in a coupe glass.
  
ingredients:
  - 45ml london dry gin
  - 22ml lemon juice
  - 22ml triple sec
  - 15ml simple syrup
  - 22ml egg white
notes: |
  22ml egg white is about little less than a medium egg white. using a whole egg white (about 30ml) is totally ok but methinks that less is more balanced
