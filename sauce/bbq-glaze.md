maltose is evil but *non negotiable*, don't think that any sub would give the same stickiness.

## ingredients

- 200ml ketchup
- 60ml smoky whisky
- 3spn brown sugar
- 3spn maltose
- 3spn rice vinegar
- 2spn worchestershire sauce
- 1spn soy sauce
- 1spn mustard
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 dried red chillies
- .5spn black pepper

## preparation

crush dried chillies, mix everything else in a pan and heat over medium to simmer and reduce.

## notes

smoky whisky can be replaced with bourbon/mild rye plus 1spn smoked salt. sounds like a rather random ingredient,
but I have some for no good reason and had some horrid sazerac rye that I needed to use in something that isn't a drink and worked just fine.

this keeps for a while.
