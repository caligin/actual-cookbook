# agua-de-lourdes

aka the flatfish moisturiser.

make this in a squeezy bottle and use liberally when cooking big flatfish on a bbq, like a brill or turbot.

the real deal is used in a famous turbot resaurant in spain - I have no idea what's in the og one or whether this is even close but the intended usage is the same.

## ingredients

- 15g salt
- 60g rice vinegar
- 15g moscatel vinegar
- 40g extra virgin olive oil

## preparation

pour in a squeezy bottle, shake vigorously to emulsify. reshake before each use.
