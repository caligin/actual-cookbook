From [Andy Makes Grilled Salmon with Lemon Sauce](https://video.bonappetit.com/watch/andy-makes-grilled-salmon-with-lemon-sauce).

Serves 1 or 2 if you make some good sides.

## ingredients

- 2 salmon fillets
- 1 lemon
- 1 shallot
- .5spn sesame seeds
- .5spn honey
- .5spn sesame oil
- .5spn pepper
- 80ml evoo
- salt
- basil

## preparation

scale salmon, season with salt on both sides, coat evenly with a layer of evoo.

chop shallot fine, peel lemon and chop skin, put all the ingredients except basil in a bowl (and squeeze the lemon core in it) and mix.

cook salmon skin down, covered, for 6-8m. serve with sauce all around and garnish with basil.

## notes

the best thing you can do is to use toasted szechuan pepper instead of regular black pepper, it really shines in this sauce.
