# sarde in savor

from: [TODO I left the tab with the source recipe open on a different machine!](TODO)

so I wanted to buy herring for a different thing, and got sardines by mistake instead. so I decided to go for this recipe that is traditional from the side of Italy around Venice or Trieste.

## ingredients

- 2 onons
- 270g sardines
- 4spn raisins
- 150ml vinegar
- 2spn sugar
- 3spn pine seeds

## preparation

- TODO I forgot, see the original recipe! but along the lines of:

- slice onion
- soak raisins in white wine
- pan fry onion until transparent, add sugar, vinegar
- reduce to 1/4
- lightly toast pine seeds
- deep fry sardines at low temp for a couple of minutes, just enough to make them lightly broned
- combine everything in layers of sardines - everythingelse
- let sit in the fridge overnight
