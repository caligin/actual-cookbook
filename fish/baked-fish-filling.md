# baked fish filling

This is my favourite filling for baked fish. Just fill either sea bass or sea bream with it and throw in oven for some time.

## ingredients

- olive oil
- breadcrumbs
- capers
- garlic
- parsley

TODO figure out exact measurements. capers are just a little

## preparation

just mix everything together
