# shioyaki mackerel

From [Mackerel recipe - How to grill salted mackerel - サバのしおやき](https://youtu.be/askf71pqrPY)

Servers 1.

## tools

- (optional) skewers

## ingredients

- 2 mackerel fillets
- coarse salt

## preparation

- preheat oven, upper grill settings at 200C
- cut some cross-cut incisions on the skin side so it doesn't curl up while grilling
- cut fillets in half
- use 3 skewers in a V shape to support 2 pieces during cooking
- apply some coarse salt to taste on both sides
- skin side down first, 5 minutes then 3 with skin side up

## notes

I wrote serves 1 but I usually serve this as an appetizer for 1 not as a main. Or as a snack.

Keep the fish reasonably close to the top grill of the oven. This way you don't even need to close the oven in case the skewers don't fit.

To remove the skewers without exploding the fish apply a spinning motion on the skewer while extracting it.

You can do without skewers as long as you have a way to get the fish out to flip it.

Also, you either have a very sharp knife or you risk demolishing the fish while applying the cross-cuts, you might be better of without if your blade is not vorpal +5.

Servers on top is not a typo, it's a very elaborate pun.
