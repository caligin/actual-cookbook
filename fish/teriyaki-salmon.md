Serves 1.

## tools

- aluminium foil

## ingredients

- 1 salmon fillet
- vegetable oil
- salt
- white pepper
- 2 spn sake
- 3 spn teriyaki sauce

## preparation

- apply a shallow X cut on the skin side of the salmon
- heat a gulp of vegetable oil very hot (enough oil to barely cover the whole surface of the pan works yoi)
- add salmon skin side dow
- apply salt and white pepper on top of salmon
- turn heat down to mid-low
- cover salmon with foil and cook for ~7 min
- flip and cook on flesh side ~3 min (keeping covered with foil)
- add sake and turn to high heat to deglaze
- once alcohol is consumed turn down heat again and add teriyaki sauce
- have the teriyaki thicken while continuously pouring it over the fish
- it's ready when the sauce looks sticky-ish (usually just a few minutes)

## notes

Fillet size is up to you, I go for what's sold as a 1-portion at supermarkets. That by the way comes in two thinner slices so the X incision is unnecessary. Also, you either have a very sharp knife or you risk demolishing the fish, just give up on the incision if your blade is not vorpal +5.

I pour a random amount of sake directly from the bottle. The spannometric amount is "a couple of gulps so it distributes evenly around the circumference of the pan".

Similarly for the teriyaki sauce, from the pan where I prepare it, "enough to have a thin uniform layer on the whole surface of the pan".

Tbh last time I cooked this it was a bit dry, might be worth trying cook it a minute less per side or something. But it probably depends on your pan and stove so experiment's on you.
