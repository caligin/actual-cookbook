# actual cookbook

Got tired to write chef cookbooks so here's *literally* a cookbook.

I take recipes mostly from youtube videos so I might just link to those with some extra details.

This has been inspired by [1337 Noms, the hacker's cookbook](https://github.com/theDevilsVoice/1337-Noms-The-Hacker-Cookbook) plus the necessity to collate my recipes in one place somewhere as I keep forgetitng where to find the quantities.

## measurements

Sometimes quantities are measured in unscientifical or spannometric units.

I can't possibly deal with `tsp` and `tbsp`, I keep forgetting which one is which because I think it's more intuitive that the shorter symbol is the one with less qualifiers and a tablespoon is just. a. spoon. while a teaspoon has a legit qualifier. So I'll use spoons `spn` and coffeespoons `coffeespn` instead. Coffee and not tea because I find tea repulsive.

I'm not sorry for the confusion caused.

```
1 tbsp = 1 spn,
1 tsp  = 1 coffeespn.

```

## navigating this repo

More than one course is probably not happening if you're cooking yourself so stuff is grouped by type of food. Sections will eventually contain a README with the section's ToC, for now you'll have to refer to the filenames.

Some recipes are still wip or just placeholders, be patient!
